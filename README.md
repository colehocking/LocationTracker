# LocationTracker

This is a simple application to calculate the distanced traveled using an android phone's GPS. The user's current latitude/longitude are 
updated every 2000ms (2s) and the distance is calculated using the previously retrieved latitude/longitude.

The user can manually adjust the GPS refresh rate via text input. The input will be read and calculated in milliseconds
